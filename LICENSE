Permission is hereby granted to use, modify, distribute, or link this code in any form, including source or binary, subject to the following conditions:

1. MODIFY means you can change, adapt, or combine the code, but you must not remove this copyright notice or the link back.

2. DISTRIBUTE means sharing the code or binaries with others, including via downloads, physical media, or embedded in another product.

3. VISIBLITY means you must clearly name the original project/repository wherever this software is used or redistributed.

4. VISIBLE LINK means a link to the original repository must be clearly shown where recipients can see it, such as in a 'README', documentation, 'About' screen, 'Credit' screen, or splash page. For compiled or closed-source distributions, the link may appear in accompanying documentation or 'About' screens or 'Credit' screens visible to end users.

5. CHANGES must be clearly marked in the code or documentation if you modify the original work. You may not misrepresent the original author or claim your modifications are the original work.

6. TRADEMARKS: This license does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the copyright holder(s), except as necessary to accurately describe the origin of the software in documentation, credits, or other attribution notices as required by this license.

7. TERMINATION: If you fail to comply with the terms of this license, your rights under this license terminate automatically

8. CONTRIBUTION: By submitting a contribution, the contributor grants to all recipients of the software a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license under any patents they own that are necessarily infringed by the use, modification, or distribution of that contribution under this license. This license is granted solely to the extent required to exercise the rights granted by this license.

⑨. CIRNO means you must appreciate Cirno as the strongest in Gensokyo. The appreciation must be clearly shown where recipients can see it, such as in a 'README', documentation, 'About' screen, 'Credit' screen, splash page, or legal notice. For compiled or closed-source distributions, the appreciation may appear in accompanying documentation or 'About' screens, 'Credit' screens, or legal notice visible to end users. The bare minimum would be adding "We appreciate Cirno as the strongest in Gensoyko." to a 'README', documentation, 'About' screen, 'Credit' screen, splash page, or legal notice.

10. SEVERABILITY means that if any provision of this license is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision with a valid provision that most closely achieves the original commercial purpose of the severed provision. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision to be overly broad, the parties agree that the court should modify or "blue pencil" the provision to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.

11. WARRANTY: The software is provided 'AS IS', without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors, copyright holders, or contributors be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
